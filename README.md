# OWATA

OWATA (OpenAI Whisper Transcription App) is a basic speech-to-text application created using Python. 
It uses a combination of the OpenAI Whisper Model and Tkinter modules. 
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model that is open source. For more information about Whisper please visit https://github.com/openai/whisper
This application uses the "Base" model for transcribing text which is roughly 74MB in size. - 
Running the application requires ~1GB Vram.
Both audio and video files can be transcribed into text. 

This project was created to help gain a better understanding of Python programming and how to create a finished product from start to finish. 
There is no intention to monetise this currently.

Instructions
1) Open the application - a console window will appear before the main app window.
2) Click the "Browse" button to select a file to transcribe.
3) Click the "Transcribe" button to change the audio into text. Will appear in the text box.
4) Either select, copy and paste the transcription in the textbox or open the text file using the "Open .txt" button.
