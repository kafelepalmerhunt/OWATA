# OWATA

OWATA (OpenAI Whisper Transcription App) is a basic speech-to-text application created using Python. 
It uses a combination of the OpenAI Whisper Model and TKinter modules. 
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model that is open source. For more information about Whisper please visit https://github.com/openai/whisper
This application uses the "Base" model for transcribing text which is roughly 74MB in size. - 
Running the application requires ~1GB Vram.

This project was created to help gain a better understanding of Python programming and how to create a finished product from start to finish. 
There is no intention to monetise this currently.
